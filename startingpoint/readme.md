## Introduction
Starting Point is the learning path within Hack The Box that teaches the basics of penetration testing. This folder holds the documentation on how I pwned each box and worked through each lab.

There are **three** different tiers to Starting Point. According to Hack The Box:

### Tier 1
In the first tier, you will gain essential skills in the world of cybersecurity pen-testing. You'll start by learning how to connect to various services, such as FTP, SMB, Telnet, Rsync, and RDP anonymously. Next, you'll discover the power of Nmap, a valuable tool for identifying open ports on target systems, allowing you to assess their vulnerabilities. Lastly, you'll explore connecting to a MongoDB server, adding a valuable layer to your penetration testing knowledge. This tier will lay a strong foundation for your journey into the realm of cybersecurity.

✔️ Learn how to connect FTP, SMB, Telnet, Rsync, and RDP anonymously.

✔️ Learn how to use Nmap to identify open ports.

✔️ Learn how to connect to a MongoDB server.

### Tier 2
In the second tier, you'll delve deeper into the world of cybersecurity pen-testing, focusing on web exploitation techniques suitable for beginners. You'll discover the basics of SQL injection, Server Side Template Injection, and Remote File Inclusion, and gain a grasp of how to use Web/Reverse Shells effectively. Building on the knowledge from the first tier, you'll apply these techniques to exploit various services showcased earlier, ensuring a hands-on understanding of their vulnerabilities.

Additionally, you'll learn how to navigate Jenkins, a popular automation server, to log in and upload a Groovy Shell Script, a valuable skill for penetration testing. Finally, you'll round out your expertise by understanding how to upload files to an S3 Bucket, providing you with a comprehensive range of skills to excel in the cybersecurity field. This tier takes you one step further in your pen-testing journey.

✔️ Learn basic web exploitation techniques such as SQL injection, Server Side Template Injection, Remote File Inclusion and how to use Web/Reverse Shells.

✔️ Use the services showcased in the previous tier for exploitation.

✔️ Learn how to log in to Jenkins and upload a Groovy Shell Script.

✔️ Learn how to upload files to an S3 Bucket.

### Tier 3
In the third tier, you will acquire advanced skills in cybersecurity pen-testing, extending your knowledge and capabilities. You'll start by mastering the art of exploiting vulnerabilities like XXE, IDOR, and Log4j, allowing you to uncover and leverage weaknesses in target systems. You'll also delve into the world of cookie manipulation, giving you the ability to manipulate and control user sessions, a crucial skill for ethical hacking.

As you progress, you'll learn about binary path hijacking and exploiting sudo permissions, enabling you to perform privilege escalation effectively. Understanding the basics of Brute Forcing will be a valuable tool in your pen-testing toolkit, helping you uncover weak passwords and gain unauthorized access.

Moreover, you'll explore how to exploit LXD for privileged filesystem access and gain insights into exploiting insecure functions like "strcmp()" in PHP, which are frequently used in web applications. This comprehensive tier equips you with a broad range of advanced techniques and knowledge for a successful career in cybersecurity pen-testing.

✔️ Learn how to exploit XXE, IDOR, Log4j and perform cookie manipulation.

✔️ Learn how to exploit binary path hijacking and sudo permissions for privilege escalation.

✔️ Learn the basics of Brute Forcing.

✔️ Learn how to exploit LXD for privileged filesystem access

✔️ Learn how to exploit insecure functions like "stcmp()" in PHP.
